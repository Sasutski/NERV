# NERV Spherical Projection Interface 🌐🔬

## 📡 Project Overview

A hyper-stylized, Neon Genesis Evangelion-inspired web interface featuring an interactive 3D sphere with dynamic visualizations, technical overlays, and immersive design elements.

### 🎬 Inspired by Neon Genesis Evangelion

This project captures NERV's interface design's clinical, high-tech aesthetic, blending technological mystique with cutting-edge web visualization.

## ✨ Features

- **Dynamic 3D Sphere Visualization**
  - Procedurally animated surface
  - Complex shader effects
  - Responsive interactions

- **Technical Interface Elements**
  - Scan line animation
  - Real-time system diagnostics
  - Translucent, high-tech overlay panels

- **Interactive Experiences**
  - Mouse-tracked camera movement
  - Particle system visualization
  - Continuous system state updates

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Rendering**: Three.js
- **Core Technology**: Vanilla JavaScript
- **Design Philosophy**: Evangelion UI Aesthetics

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sasutski/nerv.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd nerve-sphere-interface

# Open index.html in a modern browser
# No additional dependencies required!
```

## 🌈 Customization

Modify shader parameters, colour schemes, and interaction models in JavaScript to personalize your experience.

### Shader Customization Example

```javascript
// Adjust sphere deformation
this.material.uniforms.amplitude.value = 0.3;

// Modify colour generation
finalColor = mix(baseColor, newColor, variation);
```

## 🔍 Design Philosophy

Inspired by the technological sublime of Neon Genesis Evangelion, this interface represents a fusion of:
- Cyberpunk aesthetics
- Procedural design
- Interactive web experiences

## 🤖 Future Roadmap

- [ ] Add more complex shader effects
